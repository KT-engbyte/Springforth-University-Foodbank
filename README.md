# Springforth-University-Foodbank

---
## Project Introduction:
Springforth University planned to setup a foodbank on campus in collaboration with the United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). However, the university needs to provide empirical reasons why the foodbank should be sponsored by UNESCO. This necessitated the university to carry out a survey among the students on food insecurity and academic performance.
The response from about a thousand students and the comprehensive report that justifies why a foodbank should be setup in Springforth University is the basis for the exploratory data analysis.

**_Disclaimer_**: _The building picture is not representative of any structure in the Springforth University. Also, this project is a case study to provide justification for the need to setup a foodbank in the institution._

## Problem Statement
The Springforth University empirical reasons why a foodbank sponsored by UNESCO should be setup in the University.

## Skills demonstrated
Mastery of two tools were demonstrated:
1. 	The Microsoft excel: 
      - Excel table
![Excel_Table](https://github.com/KT-engbyte/Springforth-University-Foodbank/assets/67824380/cae6c52f-f767-4cb6-a990-4dae1d327142)

      - Pivot chart for data visualization.

2.	Power BI:
   - Use of power query editor to connect, prepare & transform data.
   - Seamless and visual determination of column quality.
   - Data exploration & descriptive analytics to support empirical evidence required for UNESCO to partner with SpU on the foodbank setup in the institution.

## DATA SOURCING
Data provided as CSV file. Transformed, analysed and visualised with Power BI. 
Also partly analysed & visualized using excel, however, discovered there were some cells in few rows were missing data.

## DATA TRANSFORMATION/CLEANING
Data was efficiently cleaned and transformed with Power Query editor of Power BI. A screen shot of some of the applied steps is as below:

## MODELLING
Modelling not required as data was provided as a single worksheet. The effectiveness of data exploration and cleaning using Power BI far more outweigh the use of excel, more so, the data is to a greater extent clean except for few missing data which are negligible and will not adversely impact decisions.  

## ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATION
Analysed and visualized data in both excel & PowerBI. Noticeable from the graphics below is the the fact that hunger affects the effectiveness of the students which was strongly agreed by about 47% of the respondents. Food of more than half of the respondents did not last and had to skip meals.

## CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION
With 80% skipping meals because their food did not last; and 30% respondents attention span often affected due to food, but just 15% missing classes because of food, indicates the following:
- Students are distracted from studies and may not get maximum benefit of their education pursuit due to food related issues.
- From the visuals above, 40% of the student respondents engage in business to buy food to support themselves.
- About 53% of the respondentsâ€™ food did not last and do not have enough food.
- The students showed determination in their academic pursuits despite difficulties experienced in feeding well and distraction caused due to lack of adequate food.
  
In addition to other empirical facts derivable from the data and visuals, there is justification for UNESCO to collaborate with the SpU University to setup a foodbank in the University. 
Also, as an incentive, some of these students can be taken up on part time to reduce cost and ensure the foodbank meets its desired purpose for the institution.  UNESCO can do more for less by scaling this program while providing a token for student volunteers to ensure program is successful and scaled appropriately.
